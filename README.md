# Movie recommender system
This is a schoolproject in which a recommender system is made in PostGreSQL and Python. 
This is done based on scraped data from metacritic of the movie pages (including data about titles, actors and summary),
and scraped data from metacritic of the user reviews. The .sql files are commands in which the content based recommendations are done and 
the .py file is the one in which the user based recommendations is done. In the python file however I have yet to figure out how to compute
which movies all the authors who wrote a review on The Godfather Part III liked.
